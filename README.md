OICE RECOGNITION SYSTEM:SPEECH-TO-TEXT is a software that lets the user control computer functions and dictates text by voice. The system consists of two components , first component is for processing acoustic signal which is captured by a microphone and second component is to interpret the processed signal, then mapping of the signal to words. Model for each letter will be built using Hidden Markov Model(HMM). Feature extraction will be done using Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficients(MFCC). Home automation will be completely based on voice recognition system.
